<div style="text-align: justify ">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 Targets and 232 unique (244 with duplicate) indicators. SGDs are built upon the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and are an urgent call for actions by all countries – regardless of their situation - in a global partnership. These Goals recognise that ending poverty and other deprivations must go together with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests (United Nations, 2019).

Agenda 2030 further, embodies the belief that development can be best pursued by addressing interrelated economic, social and environmental issues. The 2030 Agenda commits to <b><i>'leaving no one behind'</i ></b> and including the most vulnerable groups in a society. Therefore, the focus is placed on the disaggregation level of the indicators concerning vulnerable groups such as children, youth, people with disabilities, indigenous groups, refugees etc.</div>

### UN SDGs Indicators Framework

<div style="text-align: justify ">An Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDGs Indicators (IEAG-SDGs) agreed upon the global indicator framework to monitor progress on the 17 Goals. The 244 indicators of the SDGs can be quantified as constituting of 50 indicators aimed at monitoring the “means of implementation” (speaking to policy implementation) and 194 “goal indicators” to quantify the progress made in the country.</div>

The IAEG-SDGs further, classifies the indicators into three tiers by their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level as follows:

- **Tier 1:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 % of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.
- **Tier 2:** Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.
- **Tier 3:** No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

### SDGs in Namibia 

<div style="text-align: justify ">Namibia recognizes the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals, as reflected in the contribution made by the country in the formulation processes, particularly the intra-Africa regional processes that culminated in a common negotiating instrument called the Common African Position (CAP) on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. Namibia served as a member of the High-Level Committee (HLC) representing the African sub-region. The country presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) on the progress of the SDGs at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) at the United Nations in New York in July 2018. The HLPF was briefed on how the country is adopting the global Agenda 2030 and aligning it to its 5 years National Development Plan (NDP), corresponding accelerating tool, and Harambee Prosperity Plan (HPP).  NDP5 was launched a year after the adoption of the SDGs to ensure that national processes benefit from the global discussions on the new development agenda. Furthermore, general trends in various development aspects in the country have been displayed. The coordination of the SDGs implementation is carried out within the framework of the NDP5 pre-existing three-level mechanism, namely:</div>

- Development Partners Forum at the highest level to provide coordination oversight; 
- a multi-stakeholder National Steering Committee composed of senior officials from government and development partners at implementation level to provide tracking of implementation; 
- and coordination of all developments pertaining to SDGs, through the NDP5 vehicle, which rests with the National Planning Commission (NPC) as the Secretariat (National Planning Commission Namibia, 2018). 

<div style="text-align: justify ">In conclusion, the Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) is responsible for data collection, processing and dissemination of data as well as coordination of of the National Statistics System (NSS). Therefore the SGD portal, an in-house solution of the NSA, is a platform developed to complement the SDGs Baseline Report produced in 2019 as a starting point to formalize and enhance a national reporting system of the SDGs. The portal further display current information and thus moving target in terms of the capacity of the current national reporting framework to monitor progress in the implementation of the SDG in Namibia.</div>
